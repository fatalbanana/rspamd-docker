## Basic usage

~~~
docker run -v rspamd_dbdir:/var/lib/rspamd -v rspamd_confdir:/etc/rspamd -ti rspamd/rspamd
~~~

## Configuration

In this build upstream config files are installed in `/usr/share/rspamd/config` allowing `/etc/rspamd` to contain only local configuration.

Volumes or bind mounts should be used for the `/var/lib/rspamd` directory and optionally for `/etc/rspamd`. If bind mounts are used, the `/var/lib/rspamd` directory should be writable by `11333:11333` on the host machine (or whichever uid:gid you may have explicitly started the container with, e.g. using `docker run -u`).
